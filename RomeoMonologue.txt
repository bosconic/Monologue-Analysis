There is no world without Verona walls,
But Purgatory, torture, hell itself.

Hence banished is banish'd from the world,
And the world's exile is death; then "banished,"
Is death mis-term'd. Calling death "banished,"
Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
And smil'st upon the stroke that murders me.
"Tis torture, and not mercy; heav'n is here,
Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her;
But Romeo may not; more validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo; they may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty,
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
They are free men, but I am banished.
And sayst thoug yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poision mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
But "banished" to kill me? "Banished!"

O friar! the damned use that word in hell;
Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd
To mangle me with that word "banished"?
