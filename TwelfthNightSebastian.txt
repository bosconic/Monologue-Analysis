This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
This is the pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio then?
I could not find him at the Elephant;
Yet there he was, and there I found this credit,
That he did range the town to seek me out.
His counsel now might not do me golden service;
For though my soul disputes well with my sense
That this may be some error, but no madness,
Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
That I am ready to distrust mine eyes,
And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
To any other trust but that I am mad
Or else that lady's mad: yet, if 'twere so,
She could not sway her house, command her followers,
With such smooth, discreet, and stable bearing
As I perceive she does. There's something isn't
That is decievable. But here the lady comes.
