        "# Introduction\n",
        "I have a bad habit of collecting books that I hope to read but end up not reading them. The books end up collecting dust in my room and this causes my family to keep reminding me to move some books downstairs...As I was cleaning my room, re-organizing these books I had realized that I had purchased this book called: *The Actor's Book of Classical Monologues collected and edited by Stefan Rudnicki*. As I picked up the book again I was skinning through the pages remembering why the book was in my collection and then I realized that the book was an anthology of Monologues recommended by Stefan Rudnicki for up and coming actors or students in the dramatic arts. Did I think I was going to be one of these aspiring actors to use one of the monologues in an audition? The answer is no, however I was intrigued by how the book was divvied up among the different time periods/time period and genere of the monologues (as the book contains monologues dating back from the Greek Dramas all the way to the eighteenth century). Within each time period/ time period genre the monologues were divided by the heading: \"Monologues for Men\" or \"Monologues for Women\"(Rudnicki, 2009). The reason for the division of monologues by gender identity was because of the gender identity of the character who was speaking the monologue within the respective play. I should mention that the collector and editor of the anthology, Stefan Rudnicki did not intend for specific monologues to be solely portrayed by men or women. But I was thinking to see by looking at the words of the monologues only maybe I can investigate if this division of gender identity for monologues could potentially hold up within the acting world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Connecting this to python and the world of programming languages, I had read about sentiment analysis on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis). After reading the page, I had lots of questions, and I did not think I was able to apply sentiment analysis as I thought it was too difficult for me to make the leap from learning how to code to applying sentiment analysis through monologues. But I was wrong, I had discussed this idea with my professor Dr.Maher Elshakankiri, and he had provided me with Deitel's Chapter 12: Natural Language Processing (NLP) from his book: *Intro to python for computer science and data science: Learning to program with AI, Big Data and the cloud*. Within this project I will analyze 6 monologues, from three different plays to potentially draw on some insights behind the emotions of each of the monologue and how it relates to the speaker/actor. Potentially there can be a more broad claim to make to see how the writers of the monologues had percieved the specific parts of the characters to have a certain affect on the audience.\n",

The reason I had decided to use this first play was because, it was the first play I was first introduced to when learning about the plays of William Shakespeare. The play is also very accessible, and known globally by the two main actors, Romeo (who is typically one of the male lead roles in the play) and the other role Juliet (who is typically one of the female lead roles in the play) so when I had found the monologues from the characters within Stefan Rudnicki's book[5], I just assumed it would provide a start towards me finding the answer if monologues can be assessed by sentiment to be played by particular actors. \n",

        "This section is concerned with the analysis of Sebastian and Viola's monologues within the play Twelfth Night. These two monologues were also found in Stefan Rudnicki's book[5]. The fun part here is that Twelfth night is a comedy about a pair of twins (Sebastian and Viola) who were seperated and Viola has been caught up in a love triangle and throughout a portion of the play Viola disguises herself as Cesario (a male character). I had decided to choose this play as my second group of character monologues to analyze as I wanted consider maybe the sentiment analysis for monologues from comedies may be different than the sentiment analysis for monologues from tragedies. \n",

        "This graph shows the sentiment polarity scores of the different monologues, from the data frame and polarity graph above there seems to be a trend that  monologues for women seem to have a more positive polarity score, even when factoring comedys and tragedies. As well as different tragedies, all of the women leads (Juliet, Viola and Io) at a first pass through the basic sentiment analysis tend to be more positive than the male counter parts (Romeo, Sebastian and Prometheus).\n",
        "\n",

        "Prometheus' monologue and Io's monologue seem to be roughly the same with their polarity scores both containing negative scores (sentiment polarity score for prometheus: -0.009687 , sentiment polarity score for Io -0.008879). So if we were looking solely at sentiment polarity the 2/3 results are significant differences between male and female monologues.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final take away from the sentiment polarity analysis is that the scores themselves are pretty low meanining the NLTK library corpus used to compare the monologues had found the monologues generally are neural, slightly positive at best."

        "This graph shows a more in-depth sentiment analysis of the monologues. The data provided for this graph was generated from another Sentiment analysis code, involving a different library corpra (movie_reviews). The Sentiment Analysis tool is called: \"NaiveBayesAnalyzer\", This specific choice of analyzer and new library was provided by Dr. Elshakankiri and Deitel Ch.12 [2]. The reason for providing a visual for the negative sentiment polarity score was because the positive sentiment polarity scores of the monologues did not show any meaningful information, the results closely resemble one another.\n",
        "\n",
        "When examining the graph there seems to be a larger negative sentiment polarity scores for the male characters (Romeo, Sebasian and Prometheus). This also repeats the point mentioned above when looking at the simple polarity scores above, the female characters (Juliet, Viola and Io) tend to have a less negative polarity sentiment score. However when looking at the numbers themselves the insight about negativity sentiment polarity scores is different.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although Romeo and Juliet seem to be near eachother but from the data frame the scientific notation is not represented here properly. Romeo's monologue has a negative sentiment polarity score of 5.485967e-08, compared to Juliet's monologue which has a negative sentiment score of 9.743007e-11. This new perspective changes the way we think about the simple polarity ratings as this added benefit of seeing the extensive analysis on the polarity score shows that not all text is simply just positive nor simply just negative, even the seemingly positive monologues contain parts of negativity as well. This also shows how intricate the NLTK tool is when analyzing text."

        "This last graph I had decided to generate is the subjectivity score of each of the monologues. The subjectivity score focuses on how 'personal' the overall text is to the speaker[2]. As expected monologues tend to possess both objective and subjective qualities as when they are performed on stage sometimes they are used by the character to provide some insight to what the character is going through. This is why the monologues seem to be near the 0.4 and 0.5 on the graph. Most of the time these monologues are not interupted by other characters, this is just a tool use by the author to speak towards the audience or bring forth new parts of the play that add to the immersive experience to the performance. \n",

        "When examining the graph it seems that two of the male characters in William Shakespeare's plays (Romeo and Sebastian) have a slightly larger outcome in their subjectivity than the female characters (Juliet and Viola). Viola's monologue also visually represents the lowest score of subjectivity compared to the rest of the monologues.\n",

        "# Conclusion\n",
        "As you, the reader can probably tell the question of a monologue being used by someone of a particular gender identity is not a easy subject to tackle. I am well aware that just looking at three plays, two plays which are from the same playwright and comparing the monologues, that were made for male characters that were deemed for male actors to perform versus the monologues of the female characters that were deemed for female actors to perform. \n",
        "\n",
        "What I can say for certain is from the sentiment analysis done here in this project within the three plays:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Romeo and Juliet by William Shakespeare\n",
        "*   Twelfth Night by William Shakespeare\n",
        "*   Prometheus Bound by Robert Lowell *Derived from Aeschylus* \n",
        "\n",
        "And comparing the monologues of the Male characters: Romeo, Sebastian and Prometheus to the Female characters: Juliet, Viola and Io. There is a difference in sentiment between the male characters and female characters.\n",
        "The male characters tend to possess more negative sentiment both from simple sentiment polarity analysis as well as applying the Naive Bayes Analyzer. The female characters on the other hand seem to have a more positive sentiment analysis both from the simple sentiment polarity analysis as well as looking at the results from the Naive Bayes Analyzer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The subjectivity scores do not provide much insight, to answering whether or not gender identity has an effect on a particular character, but can provide a different perspective when considering the affect the monologues have on the listener/reader. \n",
        "\n",
        "Moving forward I think my research could potentially isnpire many researchers about asking questions about the plays we enjoy. This research also can ask many other drama professionals/enthusiasts and data scientists to consider there can be a large wealth of untapped potential here. As both spaces involve improvising and being creative with what is at their dispoasl. This can also provide some actors insights to how certain words without much context (as computers are not people, context is hard for a computer to recognize) can be percieved as, which is fascinating to think about."
