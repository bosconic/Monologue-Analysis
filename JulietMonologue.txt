Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus' lodging; such a waggoner
As PhaÃ«thon would whip you to the west,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtian, love-performing night!
That runaway's eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen!
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties: or, if love can be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night! come, Romeo! come, thou day in night!
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night,
Whiter than snow on a raven's back.
Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-brow'd night,
Give my Romeo: and, when he shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night,
And pay no worship to the garnish sun.
O! I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess'd it, and though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy'd. So tediousis this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O! here comes my nurse.
